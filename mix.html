        There is just something different about early Britney love songs. They hit harder than any other songs for me. Most of Britney's early music is about love songs, and they are really special to me. When I was living alone last year during the height of the pandemic, I would listen to these songs and it would make me feel like I had somebody- even if they drive me crazy.

    These songs aren't "bad" at all, they are badd songs. They make you feel like a BO$$. They transcend you to another  planet. 
    They have this effect where you cannot stop strutting down the street, imagining you are Naomi Campbell
    on the runway. They infect your mind with main character disease, they delude your thoughts into 
    convincing yourself that you are a popstar.

    When Britney was finally able to start making more grown-up music, that is when her career took a turn.
    A turn for the best, her most iconic songs are about sex. "3", "Womanizer," "If U Seek Amy," most of 
    her number one hits are all about it. She really has such a way with worrds and her voice is sexy, so why 
    wouldn't she make bops about sex?

        This was so hard for me to do, but here is the list of best tracks from each of her albums.  Now, I think every song
        she has made is her greatest hit, but these ones just give a little more. They are the songs you play on replay.
        I included her remix albums and greatest hit compilations as well, because these still are really her albums.

            Here it is. The playlist that started it all. My very first Britney playlist, and I loaded all of my fav tracks onto 
            here. I remember the day I made this, I was a senior in highschool and it marked my departure from being the boy 
            obsessed with Lady Gaga and onto the boy obsessed with Britney Spears (and lady gaga, but since it was an older obsession
            everbody was sick of it.)

                I acknowledge my flaws. I totally was not ahead of my time the first time I heard these tracks. However, these tracks
                really have become some of my favorite songs ever. Like wine, they age with time and they grow on you. I think that 
                people need to step out of their comfort zones with music because you might find something you will like, even if it
                is by one of your favorite artists.

                    I am a pop music critic. It consumes my life, somedays it is all I do. Just lay back and listen to all the new pop music 
                    that's been released. Friday's are so busy! That's new music release day for the US. Anyways, with all this pop music listening
                    that I do, it is easy to recognize when Britney is inspiring new songs. She has such a signature beat, signature kind of lyric
                    compsition, and it influences most pop girls to this day! Everyone from Gaga to Adele.
