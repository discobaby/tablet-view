        I've really been feeling "...Baby One More Time" lately and since the weather is becoming colder, this track is perfect. It really is an ode to wanting to be with someone, cuddled up under all those blankets.

        There is just something different about early Britney love songs. They hit harder than any other songs for me. Most of Britney's early music is about love songs, and they are really special to me. When I was living alone last year during the height of the pandemic, I would listen to these songs and it would make me feel like I had somebody- even if they drive me crazy.

    These songs aren't "bad" at all, they are badd songs. They make you feel like a BO$$. They transcend you to another  planet. 
    They have this effect where you cannot stop strutting down the street, imagining you are Naomi Campbell
    on the runway. They infect your mind with main character disease, they delude your thoughts into 
    convincing yourself that you are a popstar.

    When Britney was finally able to start making more grown-up music, that is when her career took a turn.
    A turn for the best, her most iconic songs are about sex. "3", "Womanizer," "If U Seek Amy," most of 
    her number one hits are all about it. She really has such a way with worrds and her voice is sexy, so why 
    wouldn't she make bops about sex?
